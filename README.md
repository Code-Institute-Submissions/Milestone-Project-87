# MoveOn

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![MoveOn Responsive Design](https://github.com/mkthewlis/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/am_i_responsive.png)

*MoveOn* is an app that aims to help users prepare for relocating to their new home. My aim with this project was to create an app that would be intuitive, useful and enjoyable to use. 

Having moved home several times in my life, I know the importance of being well organised before each move. And as I have always relied on lists to help me plan ahead, I also know how useful a checklist can be! 
My idea therefore came from creating a project that would meet the needs of other users who would soon be moving home themselves.

This was the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at *The Code Institute*. The main requirements were to build a full-stack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Flask and MongoDB.

## UX

### Main aims

- To create an app that has real-world value for users who are moving homes. 

- To achieve the first aim, it was essential that this app would satisfy all CRUD functions, allowing users to Create, Read, Update and Delete their own moving tasks within their user account.

- To make the website interactive, by adding JavaScript to create a positive user experience.

- To make navigation intuitive, with prompts to guide the user in the right direction if lost and flash messages to confirm their actions.

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

The following User Stories helped me to create a design that would satisfy the needs of several different types of users.

#### Project stakeholders

- I am the creator of this app and want to make sure that it adds value to users to encourage them to return, by ensuring the app is intuitive to use, fully responsive and sleek in design.

#### New users

- I am a user who relies on apps for all aspects of my life, from finding recipes, measuring the number of steps that I walk and monitoring the temperature of my home. Naturally as I prepare to move, I want to find an app that can help me organise my plan of action.
- I am a young user who has never moved home before but is now getting ready to leave the family home. I want an app to help me stay organised and plan for the upcoming move.

#### Returning users

- I am user who has recently moved home and used this app to help me do so. My friend has now asked for my help in planning their move, so I want to share the app with them. 
- I created an account a few days ago and need to add more items to my moving to-do list.

#### Tablet user

- I am a user who primarily uses an iPad Pro to browse websites. I want to have a good experience on this website and view all the features in an equally aesthetic way.
