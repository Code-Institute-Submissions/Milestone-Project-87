# MoveOn

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 2

![MoveOn Responsive Design](https://github.com/mkthewlis/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/am_i_responsive.png)

*MoveOn* is an app that aims to help users prepare for relocating to their new home. My aim with this project was to create an app that would be intuitive, useful and enjoyable to use. 

Having moved home several times in my life, I know the importance of being well organised before each move. And as I have always relied on lists, I also know how useful a checklist can be! 
My idea therefore came from creating a project that would meet the needs of other users who would soon be moving home themselves.

This was the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to build a full-stack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Flask and MongoDB.

## UX

### Main aims

- To create an app that has real-world value for users who are moving homes. 

- To achieve the first aim, it was essential that this app would satisfy all CRUD functions, allowing users to: Create, Read, Update and Delete their own moving tasks.

- To make the website interactive through the use of JavaScript, adding to a positive user experience.

- To make navigation intuitive, with prompts to guide the user in the right direction if lost and flash messages to confirm their actions.

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

The following User Stories helped me to create a design that would satisfy the needs of several different types of users.

#### Project stakeholders

- I am one of the creators of this platform and want to see it succeed. I would like to attract users in the hope of raising awarenss about plastic waste in our oceans and increasing our newsletter followers in order to make a difference.

#### New users

- I am a user who has never really considered that plastic waste in our oceans might be a problem. I want to use this website to learn more about the problem and want to see how much I've actually now learnt by taking the quiz.
- I am a user who wants to stay up to date on the plastic waste problem, preferably with the latest news and tips on what I can do to help.

#### Returning users

- I am a primary school teacher who wants to discuss plastic waste with my students. I often rely on interactive sources online to do so, and have returned to this website again as I find it useful to be able to introduce my students to the topic before testing them on what they've learnt. 
- I have used this website to learn about gyres before and now want to remind myself of where the five largest are located. 

#### Tablet user

- I am a user who primarily uses an iPad Pro to browse websites. I want to have a good experience on this website and view all the features in an equally aesthetic way.
