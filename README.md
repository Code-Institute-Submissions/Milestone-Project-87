# Work in progress!

## Milestone Project Three with *The Code Institute*.

*MoveOn* is an app that aims to help users prepare for relocating to their new home. My aim with this project was to create an app that would be intuitive, useful and enjoyable to use. 

Having moved home several times in my life, I know the importance of being well organised before each move. And as I have always relied on lists, I also know how useful a checklist can be! 
My idea therefore came from creating a project that would meet the needs of other users who would soon be moving home themselves.

This was the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at The Code Institute. The main requirements were to build a full-stack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Flask and MongoDB.

The deployed version of this project can be viewed here: https://ms3-move-on.herokuapp.com/
