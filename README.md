# MoveOn

## Code Institute: Milestone Project 3

![MoveOn Responsive Design](https://github.com/mkthewlis/Milestone-Project-3/blob/master/static/images/readme_images/am_i_responsive.png)

*MoveOn* is an app that aims to help users prepare for relocating to their new home. My aim with this project was to create an app that would be intuitive, useful and enjoyable to use. 

Having moved home several times in my life, I know the importance of being well organised before each move. And as I have always relied on lists to help me plan ahead, I also know how useful a checklist can be! 
My idea therefore came from creating a project that would meet the needs of other users who would soon be moving home themselves.

This was the third of four Milestone Projects that made up the Full Stack Web Development Program at *The Code Institute*. The main requirements were to build a full-stack site with the use of HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python + Flask and MongoDB.

## UX

### Main aims

- To create an app that has real-world value for users who are moving homes. 

- To achieve the first aim, it was essential that this app would satisfy all CRUD functions, allowing users to Create, Read, Update and Delete their own moving tasks within their user account.

- To make the website interactive, by adding JavaScript to create a positive user experience.

- To make navigation intuitive, with prompts to guide the user in the right direction if lost and flash messages to confirm their actions.

- To create a design that would be fully responsive on all devices and screen sizes. 

### User Stories

The following User Stories helped me to create a design that would satisfy the needs of several different types of users.

#### Project stakeholders

- I am the creator of this app and want to make sure that it adds value to users to encourage them to return, by ensuring the app is intuitive to use, fully responsive and sleek in design.

#### New users

- I am a user who relies on apps for all aspects of my life, from finding recipes, measuring the number of steps that I walk and monitoring the temperature of my home. Naturally as I prepare to move, I want to find an app that can help me organise my plan of action.
- I am a young user who has never moved home before but is now getting ready to leave the family home. I want an app to help me stay organised and plan for the upcoming move.

#### Returning users

- I am user who has recently moved home and used this app to help me do so. My friend has now asked for my help in planning their move, so I want to share the app with them. 
- I created an account a few days ago and need to add more items to my moving to-do list.

#### Tablet user

- I am a user who primarily uses an iPad Pro to browse websites. I want to have a good experience on this website and view all the features in an equally aesthetic way. 

### Design Process

#### Design Process: UX Research 
Before beginning the formal design process, I began by researching other similar apps already in circulation. I wanted to see how they decided to structure their design, what I thought they did well and what I would like to do differently for my project. 
My research led me to the following conclusions:
- I wanted to create an app that users could customize with their own tasks and that these would only be accessible to them.
- The design would have to be sleek, simplistic and positive to capture the user's attention and encourage them to use MoveOn as their preferred task app.
- The app would have to provide feedback to the user each time they make changes to their list, keeping them up to date on the changes they've made. 

##### The following websites were used in the research process:
- [monday.com](https://monday.com/)
- [asana](https://asana.com/)
- [Any.do](https://www.any.do/)
- [Microsoft To Do](https://todo.microsoft.com/tasks/)


#### Design process: UX Design

1. Strategy plane: While researching other to-do apps available to users, I realised that there wasn't one specifically aimed at users moving home. This confirmed to me that there were users who's needs had not yet been met; specifically, the need to have an app targeting users who are moving homes. In order to meet their needs, I realised that I would have to keep this particular type of user in mind throughout the design and planning process in order to create a successful app.

2. Scope plane: With the app idea and type of user in place, I began to consider what features would be required to create a successful and useable app. I knew that a user had to be able to create their own account, manage their tasks with the help of the four CRUD functions and find the design easy to navigate as they worked their way through their list of tasks. I also wanted the app to be personalised, with a user's chosen Username to feature in the design (for example, '"Welcome back 'Username!'").

3. Strcuture plane: Once I had narrowed down what features I wanted to include, I began to consider the structure of my design. I realised that the website would have to be presentable to external users browsing through the pages with open access, whilst creating certain pages that are only accessible to users logged in with their account. To create this distinction, I decided that the menu bar would change, with standard items being 'Home', 'Top Tips', 'Sign In' and 'Sign Up', whilst users who are logged in would see see same basic items, but would notice 'My Tasks' (instead of 'Sign In') and 'Sign Out' (instead of 'Sign Up'). This decision was made for a better user experience, as I realised that a registered user who was already logged in would not want to see the 'Sign In'/ 'Sign Up' items in their menu bar. I also made the decision that a user would be able to navigate to the 'Edit task' and 'Add new task' pages through button prompts on their 'My Tasks' page, as these functions are only possible when a user is logged in.

4. Skeleton plane: With the concept and structure in place, I began to plan the navigation route through the design. After opening the website, a new user would immediately be able to access the 'Sign Up' page by noticing a button with the same name in the menu bar (and this standard button design would reappear throughout the design to continue to prompt a new user to sign up). Conversely, existing users could either choose to sign in from the menu, or scroll down to the bottom of this page to find a 'sign in' button prompt. If, however, the user does neither of those steps and chooses to click on the next item in the menu - 'Top Tips' - they would see a list of recommended tasks to consider before moving home. This page then contains a prompt for new users to sign up to get help for moving and would feature the same sign in prompt for existing users as found at the bottom of the 'Home' page. From there, regardless of if the user navigates to the 'Sign Up' or the 'Sign In' page, they will see the same basic page structure: a form to either sign up or sign in (depending on the page they clicked on), a prompt to direct them to the other (if they choose the wrong link) and a feature image.
Regardless of which form they complete and submit, they are navigated to a personalized 'My Tasks' page for their account, which either shows their existing tasks if they are a returning user, or a prompt to add tasks if their list is empty. Clicking on the 'Add new task' button takes them to a page to create a new task which is then visible in their list. By clicking on this task, they can either mark it as complete, delete it or edit it (by being redirected to a 'Edit task' page). Once satisfied with their use of the app, they can click on the 'Sign Out' button and return to the external design and the 'Sign In' page.

5. Surface plane: 
    * The main stylistic decision I made early on was to keep the design as sleek, modern and simplistic as possible, to prevent the design from distracting the user from their use of the app. However, I did not want this decision to compromise the user experience, so I chose to rely on illustrations and graphics instead of photos to bring color and life to the app. My search for graphics led me to find [unDraw](https://undraw.co/), which is a great resource of open source illustrations that can be personalised after your chosen HEX color value.
    * With the idea of the type and style of design that I was after, I started a workspace on [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/Hv9GYC33ydTGLuwIxydgRr/Code-Institute?node-id=170%3A2) and began experimenting with my wireframes for desktop, tablet and mobile devices. As with my earlier two Milestone Projects, I found it useful to have my hero image in place, as doing so prompts me to choose the tone and theme for the rest of the design. I selected one of the images I had chosen from unDraw and personalised it with a color palette I had created with [coolors](https://coolors.co/), as shown below. I chose this palette as the colors were modern yet toned down to offer a calm and welcoming feeling to users looking for help when planning their move.
    * I turned to Google Fonts to select the fonts for my project. I wanted to find two compatible fonts that were modern and would look good in a light font weight to complement the simplistic design. I found that Roboto and Quicksand met these criteria. 
    * I began to take note of certain features that I would add later on with JavaScript. These included an arrow button in the footer to scroll smoothly back to top, a menu bar that would fill the background color on scroll down and 'copy url' icon to encourage useres to share the app with others.

> Note: Throughout the design process, I kept referring back to my original 'Main Aims', 'User Stories' and preliminary research to make sure that my project was developing as intended.

## Features

### Existing Features

This project consists of seven pages, three of which can only be accessed after a user has created an account and signed in.

#### Consistent features across all pages

- The menu at the top of the page and footer are consistent and responsive throughout the website. 
- Each page uses interactive arrows to visually encourage the user to scroll down. These can also be clicked on to take them further down the page. The arrows are either the theme blue or yellow to remain consistent on each page.
- Certain images are used more than once at various points in the website for consistency and familiarity.
- Each page begins with an image with a fixed background and is then divided into clear sections in a similar pattern.

#### Home

- The user meets a simple title that explains the purpose of the website and encourages them to read on.
- The user is then presented with a fact about ocean waste and the mission of *Our Oceans, Our Plastic*.
- The end of the page provides three links for the user: to learn more, take the quiz or sign up to the newsletter.
